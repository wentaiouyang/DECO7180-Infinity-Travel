## 📖 Project Overview
**Infinity Travel** is a retro-style pixel art web game built around the theme of "Time Travel." More than just a game, it serves as a digital vessel for cultural preservation. By gamifying historical archives, it invites players to explore the landscapes and social heritage of Queensland’s past, offering a nostalgic tribute to the days gone by.

## About our project
Our project is about a game-based website called Infinity Travel, which is a simple retro game presented in a relatively old pixel style, it not only provides people who prefer this kind of game a way to entertain, but also brings them a precious memory back to the past. Also this application presents the history of Queensland by showing players the people and places of Queensland in days of yore, which again reflects the core concept of this game - to show our yearn and respect to those memorable times in the past.

## Inspiration
As for the inspiration of our project, we generate our ideas from the retro games. The pixel style of these games has its special charm and attract people from different ages. Particularly, these are the games with the style that would bring some people back to their childhood or teenagehood, when these simple one-key controlled pixel games(only need to push space key to jump) such as “Flappy Bird” were very popular. This kind of game is easy for players to understand as well as to operate, yet could also be challenging and provide as much entertainment.Even with well developed technology of today, Google still put this “Dinosaur Jump” game on its website for users to play when they were not able to access the internet, which again confirm the solid status of classic pixel games. The dataset we chose is called “Picture of Queensland”, which include the URL of the old photos of queensland, the photo descriptions, and latitude and longitude coordinates of the photo shooting location, etc. These old photos are naturally associated with the theme of time travel. So the retro game theme, time-traveling and old photos are combined to become the current game site.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Retro Pixel Aesthetics**: Utilizes 8-bit pixel art to evoke the charm of classic handheld gaming eras.
- **Data-Driven Storytelling**: Integrates the official "Picture of Queensland" dataset to weave real historical photos, geographical coordinates, and descriptions into the gameplay.
- **Immersive Time-Hopping**: Simple, intuitive mechanics (like the spacebar jump) allow players to seamlessly traverse through different eras of Queensland.
- **Education through Interaction**: Transforms static historical archives into an engaging digital experience, making history accessible to a modern audience.

## 💡 Inspiration
Our design draws inspiration from classic "one-button" platformers such as *Flappy Bird* and Chrome’s *Dino Run*. We took this addictive, simple mechanic and fused it with the State Library of Queensland's photographic datasets. Each landmark or obstacle represents a "Time Node" leading to a fragment of the past.
